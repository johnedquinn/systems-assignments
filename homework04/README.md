Homework 04
===========

Activity 01
==
1) The ethnic diversity did not surprise me at all because most people at Notre Dame are caucasian, so inherently, the majority of computer science students are caucasian. The gender balance definitely surprised me though; I thought there were more women in the CSE department. It's still better than most CS schools

2) Yes, it does. The program treats every student equally, which is the best way to provide a welcoming and supportive environment to every student.

Activity 02

1) With python, you can include modules which provide a ton of resources for you to use. It is more object oriented, allowing you to use data structures to store lots of elements (dictionaries within dictionaries). If I were to write this script in Shell, it would've been a lot more hard-coding.

2) I'm not 100% sure if it's possible to import a module similar to "OS" in C++, so I'm not even sure if that is possible. Python is useful because it is sort of a mix between C++ and Shell, allowing us to use OOP and a scripting language to write useful programs.
